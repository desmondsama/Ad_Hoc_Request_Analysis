# Ad_Hoc_Request_Analysis
This project is part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics.


# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and SQL queries used for the Consumer Goods domain segment of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Codebasics. The project involves working with a dataset related to consumer goods, specifically from "AtliQ Hardwares," a leading global hardware company specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers. The primary objective is to address ten specific ad hoc requests using SQL queries.

# Project Structure
1. SQL Files: The SQL queries for each of the ten ad hoc requests are organized in separate SQL files. These queries are crafted to extract and manipulate the necessary data to answer the specific questions.
2. Project Presentation Files: The project presentation is available in a PPT file, summarizing the project's key aspects.
# Skills Acquired
1. Writing SQL Queries using CTEs, ranks, joins, date functions, sub-queries, numeric functions, and more.
